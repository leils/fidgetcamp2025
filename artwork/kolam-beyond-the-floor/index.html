<p>Kolam is a traditional South Indian art form where intricate patterns are drawn using rice flour, chalk, or rock powder, typically on the ground at the entrance of homes. Created daily, kolams are both decorative and symbolic - welcoming guests, inviting prosperity, and offering food to small creatures like ants. Designs range from simple geometric patterns to complex, symmetrical arrangements based on a grid of dots.</p>
