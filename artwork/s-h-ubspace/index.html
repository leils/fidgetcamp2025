<p>One of the most fortunate—and bizarre—experiences I’ve had in San Francisco was attending a party where every attendee shared my name. Well, more or less.</p>
<p>“Shub,” meaning auspicious in several Indian languages, has sprouted a variety of permutations depending on region, gender, and family tradition: Shubham, Shubhankar, Shubhan, Shubha, and more.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I remembered that the human face occupies a linear subspace—a principle from computer vision suggesting that any collection of faces can be mathematically averaged into a single composite.</p>
<p>So I set out to create the Shubiest Shub of San Francisco. Or at least, of those Shubs willing to answer a random LinkedIn invitation and show up to a party.</p>
