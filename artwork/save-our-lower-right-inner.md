title: "Save Our Lower Right Inner"
line: "The International Society for Lower Right Inner Pant Leg Safety (ISLRIPLS) is an organization devoted to increasing the safety and wellbeing of lower right inner pant legs the world over. For the Summer 2025 issue of the Journal of the ISLRIPLS, we held an interdisciplinary symposium of experts in the field of stopping bike gears from eating pant legs, seeking to address a problem commonly known as the Gear Attack Crisis.
In total, we created 10 prototype mitigations for the crisis, which include design-based, materials-based, fashion-based and religious-based solutions. Each entry includes a title, technical description and marketing tagline designed to encourage mass adoption. We encourage you to explore the prototypes and preview the bright future of lower right inner pant leg safety!"
