    The International Society for Lower Right Inner Pant Leg Safety (ISLRIPLS) is an organization devoted to increasing the safety and wellbeing of lower right inner pant legs the world over. For the Summer 2025 issue of the Journal of the ISLRIPLS, we held an interdisciplinary symposium of experts in the field of stopping bike gears from eating pant legs, seeking to address a problem commonly known as the Gear Attack Crisis. In total, we created 10 prototype mitigations for the crisis, which include design-based, materials-based, fashion-based and religious-based solutions. Each entry includes a title, technical description and marketing tagline designed to encourage mass adoption. We encourage you to explore the prototypes and preview the bright future of lower right inner pant leg safety!

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nonlinear Poetics: Painting with Text</td>
<td>memory, queerness, and knowledge are consumed and created in a nonlinear fashion. poetry, in itself, is an investigation in nonlinearity. however, whereas traditional poetry is obsessed with structure (and lack thereof), how do we push the medium of poetry to further interrogate ourselves as individuals and our lives?  this will be a generative workshop, where we will read a selection of work at the edge of poetry, pulling samples from some of the following: dear memory - victoria chang ghost of - diana khoi nguyen the best we could do - c thi nguyen the arrival - shaun tan florence - annapurna studios citizen - caludia rankine ward toward - cindy jyoung ok travesty generator - lillian yvonne bertram someone took they tongues - douglas kearney debths - susan howe plans for sentences - renee gladman  while this list is lengthy, it looks at poetics as a method of painting with text, image, and illustration. the piece, florence, moves outside this mode, as a potential extension of shaun tan’s work, to understand how a piece can be a poem without any words. to be queer, to remember, is to intrinsically interrogate one memory’s at an angle, and this workshop hopes to reckon with that through different mediums.  there will be four selected pieces which will result in a 10 minute discussion, a 10 minute generative writing period after each, specifically using a method brought . there will be a 5 minute period between each section to split into breakout rooms to share with each other, if they so wish, or commune with others of like minded obsessions. at the end, there will be a broader group share for 15 minutes with a 5 min wrap up for the two hour period.</td>
