## Workshops 
| Workshop Title | Description | Instructor(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Shitposting IRL | Learn how to make your printer other people's problem! We'll design flyers using marketing best practices to draw attention to silly things, then we will sprinkle these flyers throughout the streets of San Francisco. | Danielle Egan |
| Intro to Infrared Communication | We'll learn how to use an Arduino to send digital signals wirelessly across a room using infrared light. We'll play with some devices that use this technology (from TV remotes to laser tag), and have some open ended tinkering time for people to build their own creations. | Marty Boren |
| DIY Bioplastic and Bioresin | Create your own eco-friendly plastic for art, accessories, and more using ingredients from the grocery store! | Kelly Neuner |
| Papier-Mache Lantern Making | We'll be making simple paper lanterns using string, sticks, colored tissue paper, dried plants/flowers, and classic papier-mache techniques! You'll be able to hang your lantern or turn it into a table lamp when finished. Weird shapes encouraged if you are good (or bad) at making balloon animals. | Tess Rinaldo |
| Metal Etching by Hand | Let's make some art that's totally metal! In this workshop we will etch unique designs into metal belt buckles and business card holders. After this workshop, you will be able to create your own custom art by using inexpensive tools that can be found at a dollar store. | Charles Brandt |
| Poetic Comics & Interactive Publishing! | I've been making short interactive websites and abstract comic zines that interplay word and image to evoke emotion for a while. I want to give a workshop behind the theory of poetic comics and sequential image making, with different strategies broken down and then how that translates in print and media forms. At the end of the workshop we'll have some time to make a mini poetic comic on either web (I will make a scaffold template) or paper and do a shareout! | Connie Liu |
| Lenticulars 101 | Self explanatory. Learn the software and get to make your own. | Mackenzie Sharp |
| Ink & Zest Tattooing | We'll learn more about how tattooing works with a little demo using just needles, and also a machine. Then we move to experiment with tattooing various citrus using the stick and poke method! | Sunaya Shivakumar |
| Running AI Models on Tiny Computers | We're going to learn how to put big models on little devices to give them voices, points of view, and artistic abilities. Plants that talk back to you, a typewriter that autocompletes, and a magic eight ball that predicts something different every time you consult it are all just a Raspberry Pi away! | Alex Kauffmann |
| Nonlinear Poetics: Painting with Text | memory, queerness, and knowledge are consumed and created in a nonlinear fashion. poetry, in itself, is an investigation in nonlinearity. however, whereas traditional poetry is obsessed with structure (and lack thereof), how do we push the medium of poetry to further interrogate ourselves as individuals and our lives?  this will be a generative workshop, where we will read a selection of work at the edge of poetry, pulling samples from some of the following: dear memory - victoria chang ghost of - diana khoi nguyen the best we could do - c thi nguyen the arrival - shaun tan florence - annapurna studios citizen - caludia rankine ward toward - cindy jyoung ok travesty generator - lillian yvonne bertram someone took they tongues - douglas kearney debths - susan howe plans for sentences - renee gladman  while this list is lengthy, it looks at poetics as a method of painting with text, image, and illustration. the piece, florence, moves outside this mode, as a potential extension of shaun tan’s work, to understand how a piece can be a poem without any words. to be queer, to remember, is to intrinsically interrogate one memory’s at an angle, and this workshop hopes to reckon with that through different mediums.  there will be four selected pieces which will result in a 10 minute discussion, a 10 minute generative writing period after each, specifically using a method brought . there will be a 5 minute period between each section to split into breakout rooms to share with each other, if they so wish, or commune with others of like minded obsessions. at the end, there will be a broader group share for 15 minutes with a 5 min wrap up for the two hour period. | Ivan Zhao |
| Basics of Knotting and Tapestry | We're relearning those basic knots you were taught and promptly forgot as a kid. Then we're making art with them! Let's experiment with different materials and compositions to make mini macrame tapestries that don't look like they're straight out of a 70's home decor catalog (unless that's what you're going for) | Sitoë Thiam |
| Intro to Contemporary Stained Glass | Learn stained glass with me! We'll learn the copper foil method of stained glass and create beautiful artworks that shine in the light. We'll learn how to cut glass into shape, grind the glass, and solder the glass to create ornaments or panels (depending on the time). | Sophia Qin |
| Intro to Silicone Casting / Soft Robotics | We'll learn how to cast and mold silicone and try out some of our own 3D printed molds to see how form influences activation (pneumatics!). Come make robots with a "softer" side :) Note: will be messy. | Sofia Chen & Hannah Lienhard |
| Designing 3D-Printed Vermeil Jewelery | Tired of boring, basic Mejuri jewelry? Learn how to design your own custom rings! In this workshop, we’ll model investment-castable rings using OnShape, prototype them for form and fit with a 3D printer, and (optionally) send them out to be wax 3D-printed and investment-cast in gold-plated silver — all for around $50–$100. | Harrison Lin |

| Let's Paint! Watercolors & Acrylics | Let's sit in a park, enjoy the sun and paint! I am happy to teach watercolors or acrylics. No experience necessary, just an appreciation for the sun and curiosity about painting. I'll also bring a small still-life setup, for those who prefer to paint indoor things while sitting outside. As a secret third option, you can bring an art print you like (or a picture of it) and we can make a miniature copy of it ;-) | Connie Ye |
| Dataset Potluck | Bring a "dataset" - a collection of many items/events/entities of the same kind represented digitally or physically. We'll use techniques from data science and NLP to index the data and then use this miniature archive to make compositions like collages, ransom notes and karaoke song parodies. | Jamie Brew |
| Analog Synthesizers | Well dip our toes into the world of analog (musical) synthesizers. First we’ll talk about how op amps work, then use op amps to design a circuit that makes white noise. Then we’ll also make low pass and high pass filters to tame the white noise.  We’ll solder the circuits together and walk away with our own filtered white noise machines. | Chris Guichet |
